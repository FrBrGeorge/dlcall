dlcall lets you call C library functions from the command line.

    dlcall strlen "hello world"
    dlcall sin 2.5
    dlcall strstr "hello world" " " -r s

Arguments that parse as ints are assumed to be ints, as doubles assumed
to be doubles, and otherwise treated as strings. The default can be
overridden with

    -s 1    string "1"
    -i 1    int 1
    -c 1    char '1'
    -d 1    double 1.0

Return types are assumed to be double for functions taking a double and
int otherwise. The return type can be specified with -r X, for X one of
the characters sicd above.

dlcall only understands certain function prototypes currently, including
most string and math functions. Pull requests are welcome to add more
functions.
